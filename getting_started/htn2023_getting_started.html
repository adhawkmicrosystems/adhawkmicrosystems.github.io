There is also research to suggest that pupil diameter will change based on elements of cognitive state.</p><p>The pupil diameter measurement is largely a relative one—a baseline should be established for a given person, cognitive state, and lighting conditions. Experimental pupil diameter measurements should be compared against that baseline. Knowing the stimuli or change in conditions, that relative pupil diameter measurement can provide insights into cognitive state, for example.</p><ul><li>left pupil diameter in millimeters</li><li>right pupil diameter in millimeters</li></ul></section><section id="blink-events" class="level2"><h2>Blink events</h2><p>Blinks are captured and relayed as events.

This will help ensure you’re working with your specific glasses and they have an active Bluetooth connection.</p><p>If your glasses are connected via Bluetooth to one computer (smartphone, laptop, etc.), you will need to disconnect them before establishing a connection on a different computer (smartphone, laptop, etc.).</p></section><section id="fitting" class="level2"><h2>Fitting</h2><p>Eye tracking systems are largely comprised of physical sensors positioned near the eyes themselves. To ensure great eye tracking, you need to optimize the position of those sensors.</p><p>There are two stages to fitting:</p><ul><li>choosing the correct nosepiece for your face</li><li>learning the ideal and comfortable placement of the glasses on your face</li></ul><section id="nosepieces" class="level3"><h3>Nosepieces</h3><p>The fit of your AdHawk MindLink glasses is influenced by the type of nosepiece used as well as the position of the glasses on your nose. There are four nosepieces included in the kit. The four nosepieces are identified by coloured bands on the nose pads as shown below:</p><p><img src="./assets/mindlink_nosepiece_group_side.png" height="200" alt="Included nosepieces" /><img src="./assets/mindlink_nosepiece_group_top.png" height="200" alt="Nosepieces" /></p><p>The nosepieces have been designed to accommodate different face and nose shapes to maintain a consistent glasses position relative to the eyeball. They follow the trend shown below:</p><figure><img src="./assets/nosepieces_trend.png" height="350" alt="" /><figcaption>Nosepiece-nose general trend</figcaption></figure><p>In theory, nosepieces either change the height at which the glasses sit on your face or change the distance the glasses sit from the eye (relief). However, a combination of these may happen concurrently. In general, as you increase the nosepiece number it will add height to the glasses and increase the relief. The table below describes the change in glasses fit between the four nosepieces.</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Nosepiece #</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Colour</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>1</td><td>Reduce Height (-Y)</td><td>Pink</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>2</td><td>Reduce Relief (-Z)</td><td>Yellow</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>3</td><td>Baseline</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>4</td><td>Increase Height (+Y)</td><td>Blue</td></tr></tbody></table><figure><img src="./assets/mindlink_nosepiece_side.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Correct fit example: Side</figcaption></figure><p>In order to determine the correct height the pupil should be located mid-way between the top and bottom of the frame.</p><figure><img src="./assets/mindlink_nosepiece_front.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Correct fit example: Front</figcaption></figure><p>People of East Asian descent tend to have shallower noses and a shorter relief from the nose bridge to the surface of the cornea. For Asian faces it is recommended to begin with nosepiece 4 (blue). Look at the side profile to see if the nosepiece needs to be swapped.</p><section id="changing-nosepieces" class="level4"><h4>Changing nosepieces</h4><p>A nosepiece may be inserted or removed from the glasses by gently pinching the nosepads towards each other and sliding the bridge of the nosepiece into or out of the channel on the glasses. The index finger of the opposite hand can be used to guide the nosepiece in place. The nosepiece will snap in place once inserted fully.</p><figure><img src="./assets/insert_nosepiece-sm.png" width="300" alt="" /><figcaption>Inserting and removing a nosepiece</figcaption></figure></section></section><section id="checking-the-glasses-fit" class="level3"><h3>Checking the glasses fit</h3><p>The eyes page in the sample Flutter app can be used to see if the glasses fit properly for great eye tracking.</p><ul><li>move the glasses up and down; notice how the black frames in the app moves up and down to match the relative position</li><li>adjust the position of your glasses so that the black frames in the app ‘snap’ to the gray frames (which represents the ideal position)</li><li>you may need to make adjustments in and out (to adjust the ‘relief’ of the glasses on your face), or up and down (to adjust the height of the glasses on your face)</li></ul></section></section></section>
