<section id="overview" class="level1"><h1>Overview</h1><p>This document describes the operation of the AdHawk MindLink glasses. The AdHawk MindLink glasses kit contains a pair of eye tracking glasses capable of streaming gaze from AdHawk’s camera-free eye tracking sensors and video from the front-facing camera to a PC or the included Android mobile device. Using the eye tracking glasses and the AdHawk Hub software on either PC or Android, an eye tracking experience can be viewed in real-time or recorded for later.</p><section id="product-description" class="level2"><h2>Product description</h2><p>The AdHawk MindLink kit includes all of the necessary hardware and software required to record and review eye tracking data with the AdHawk MindLink glasses.</p><figure><img src="./assets/mindlink_kit_overview.png" width="700" alt="" /><figcaption>Kit overview</figcaption></figure><section id="adhawk-mindlink-glasses" class="level3"><h3>AdHawk MindLink glasses</h3><p>The AdHawk MindLink glasses can be plugged into a computer or the included mobile device using a Micro USB cable. Each pair of glasses contains binocular eye tracking hardware to generate eye tracking output using AdHawk’s unique camera-free eye tracking technology.</p></section><section id="smartphone" class="level3"><h3>Smartphone</h3><p>The included smartphone comes pre-loaded with the AdHawk Hub software and allows users to record eye tracking sessions in a mobile form factor. The included smartphone has been tested for interoperability and is the recommended device to be used with the AdHawk system. Other smartphones may be supported, depending upon their hardware and operating system (see <a href="#smartphone-support">Smartphone support</a>)</p></section><section id="calibration-fixture" class="level3"><h3>Calibration fixture</h3><p>The AdHawk MindLink eye tracker hardware occasionally needs to be calibrated using a process called <em>device calibration</em>. This process uses a plastic calibration grid fixture included as part of the AdHawk MindLink kit, as well as AdHawk Hub for desktop.</p><p><img src="./assets/device_calibration_fixture_open.jpg" width="300" alt="Open device calibration grid fixture" /> <img src="./assets/device_calibration_fixture_closed.jpg" width="300" alt="Closed device calibration grid fixture" /></p><p>Note that device calibration optimizes parameters related to the eye tracking hardware, while gaze calibration (or, more commonly, just <a href="#calibration">calibration</a>) optimizes user-related parameters to more closely match the eye tracker signal to your gaze. These two types of calibration are not related.</p><p>The AdHawk Hub for desktop software will alert you when a device calibration is required.</p></section><section id="nosepieces" class="level3"><h3>Nosepieces</h3><p>The kit ships with a set of replaceable nosepieces. The default nosepiece (black) comes pre-installed in the glasses and accommodates the largest number of users.</p><p>To determine which nosepiece provides the best fit, use the <em>Adjust fit</em> feature within AdHawk Hub. Additional information about the purpose of each nosepiece is provided in the <a href="#fitting">Fitting</a> section.</p></section><section id="ear-hooks" class="level3"><h3>Ear hooks</h3><p>Ear hooks are included for a more secure fit. The ear hooks are recommended in cases where the glasses may fall off or slip drastically from the user’s face.</p></section><section id="cables" class="level3"><h3>Cables</h3><p>Several cables are included and can be used to connect the AdHawk MindLink glasses to both the included Android device or a computer. The AdHawk MindLink glasses use a Micro USB connector, while the smartphone uses USB-C and most computers use USB-A. A Micro USB to USB-A adapter has been included in order to transfer data from the smartphone to a PC.</p></section><section id="anti-fog-lens-cleaning-cloth" class="level3"><h3>Anti-fog lens cleaning cloth</h3><p>The included cloth can be used to clean the lenses as well as the area inside the plastic frames.

There are four nosepieces included in the kit. The four nosepieces are identified by coloured bands on the nose pads as shown below:</p><p><img src="./assets/mindlink_nosepiece_group_side.png" height="200" alt="Included nosepieces" /><img src="./assets/mindlink_nosepiece_group_top.png" height="200" alt="Nosepieces" /></p><p>The nosepieces have been designed to accommodate different face and nose shapes to maintain a consistent glasses position relative to the eyeball. They follow the trend shown below:</p><figure><img src="./assets/nosepieces_trend.png" height="500" alt="" /><figcaption>Nosepiece-nose general trend</figcaption></figure><p>In theory, nosepieces either change the height at which the glasses sit on your face or change the distance the glasses sit from the eye (relief). However, a combination of these may happen concurrently. In general, as you increase the nosepiece number it will add height to the glasses and increase the relief. The table below describes the change in glasses fit between the four nosepieces.</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Nosepiece #</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Colour</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>1</td><td>Reduce Height (-Y)</td><td>Pink</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>2</td><td>Reduce Relief (-Z)</td><td>Yellow</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>3</td><td>Baseline</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>4</td><td>Increase Height (+Y)</td><td>Blue</td></tr></tbody></table><figure><img src="./assets/mindlink_nosepiece_side.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Correct fit example: Side</figcaption></figure><p>In order to determine the correct height the pupil should be located mid-way between the top and bottom of the frame.</p><figure><img src="./assets/mindlink_nosepiece_front.png" alt="" /><figcaption>Correct fit example: Front</figcaption></figure><p>People of East Asian descent tend to have shallower noses and a shorter relief from the nose bridge to the surface of the cornea.
