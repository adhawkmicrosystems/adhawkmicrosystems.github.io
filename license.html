Some jurisdictions prohibit exclusion or limitation of liability for implied warranties or consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you. You may also have other legal rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

AdHawk would not be able to provide the software without such limitations.</p></li><li><p><strong>TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.</strong> AdHawk may terminate this Agreement at any time if you violate its terms. Upon termination, you will immediately destroy the Software or return all copies of the Software to AdHawk (including providing certification of such destruction back to AdHawk). In the event of termination of this Agreement, all licenses granted to you hereunder shall immediately terminate.</p></li><li><p><strong>APPLICABLE LAWS.</strong> Claims arising under this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada, excluding its principles of conflict of laws and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods.
